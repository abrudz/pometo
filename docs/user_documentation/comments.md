# Comments

## Comment Your Code

The comment character is `⍝`

Anything after the comment character is ignored. (Because we are not using the variable we need to prefix it with the underscore operator - the variable is not being used in this test).

```pometo
_MyVar99 ← 1 2 3 ⍝ cool var bro
```

```pometo_results
1 2 3
```

Comments can be full line as well

```pometo
⍝ Once More Into The Breach
```

```pometo_results

```
