# Getting Started As A Developer Of The Pometo Runtime And Language

These are the basic steps you should take to get started:

* read the [language roadmap](./the_language_roadmap.md)
    * have a play with the Dyalog [live REPL](https://tryapl.org/)
    * `pometo` is closely aligned with Dyalog APL
* get the `pometo` and `rappel` repos [installed](our_development_environment.html) with their dependencies
    * [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
    * [APL fonts](./eek_how_do_I_even_type_this.md)
* read about the [development cycle](./the_development_cycle.md)
    * and then [write a test](./our_testing.md) just even `1 + 2`

At the moment we have a lot of functions implemented but only one pair of functions. Grab an operator or function you would like and get started.

The Open Source Maintainer's page has a list of simple things to be done - if you are not on the OSM programme you can still work on them, but please speak to me before grabing one. We are committed as a community to preparing achievable tasks for new contributors to help them learn in context and achieve valuable results.

Once you are a bit more familiar with the code base, go crazy, read about the toolchain, the lexer-parser, come and amaze us with your plans.
